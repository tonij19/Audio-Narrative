# Audio Narrative
 
Summary
This podcast takes a look at how Duolingo has evolved from a start-up to a multi-million dollar company. What began as a free language learning resource is now recognized by over 5000 universities as an official  language exam for English. Not all the company's developments have been received positively. The app is no longer completely free, with many resources locked behind a paywall. In addition, Duolingo has begun to utilize AI heavily as both a user feature and to generate their lesson plans. Many employees at Duolingo have been laid off because of this change, and the reputation of the app is beginning to change.
